!Important Note

Some operators are immediate
	- They iterate the entire collection as soon as they are invoked(调用，激活 to begin to run a program). For example: Count(), ToArray()
	- Iterating a collcetion more than once is a bad idea
		+ R#/Rider will warn you of this

Some operators are deferred
	- Calculations will only happen when you iterate the collection
	- E.g., Enumerable.Range(1,10).Select(rand.Next(10))
	  will yeild a completely different sequence of random numbers each time it is iterated
	- Deferred operations can be
		+ Streaming - do not have to read all data before elements are yeilded
		+ Non-streaming - must read all source data before they yeild an element
