IEnumberable<T> is an interface
	- Has a weakly-typed IEnumerable counterpart

LINQ are implemented as extension methods on
	- IEnumberable<T>, taking Func<> arguments
	  This is called LINQ to Objects and is used for in-memory objects
	- Iqueryable<T>, taking Expression<> arguments
	  This is used in e.g. LINQ to Entities (EF) for databases and remote connections

IEnumberable<T> Is Special

Used by foreach

Methods that return IEnumerable or IEnumerator are considered iterator methods
	- yield return x;
	  returns a single iterated value
	- yield break;
	  break the iteration

IEnumberable<T> vs Enumberable

Enumerable is a concrete class, not an interface!

Contains:
	- Static generator methods for making sequences. e.g., Enumberable.Range()
	- LINQ extension method definitions
