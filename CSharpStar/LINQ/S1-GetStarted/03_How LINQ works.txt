LINQ = language integrated query

A technology for searching and filterling data sets
	- LINQ to Objects: for working with arrays, list, etc/
	- LINQ to ENtities: for databases
	- LINQ to XML
	- LINQ to ...

Why? Because processing data with for/foreach loops is tedious.


LINQ is implemented in two different ways:
	- Extension methods (operators, common used)
	- Query expression syntax: SQL-like syntax directly embedded into C# (not covering in this course)

LINQ operators are higher-order functions
	- Functions taking functions
	- to filter out elements, a LINQ operator takes a predicate i.e. a Func<T, bool>

LINQ operators presnet a fluent interface
	- Calls can be chained
